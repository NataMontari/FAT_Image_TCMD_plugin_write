Introduction
============

FATImage is a wcx (archive) plugin for 64-bit and 32-bit Total Commander (TCmd) 
supporting access to the floppy disk images and FAT images in general, including partitioned.
> There are several such good plugins for the 32-bit TCmd, but none (to the best of my knowledge) for the 64-bit TCmd. 
> > IMG Plugin for Total Commander (TCmd) by IvGzury was used as a starting point because its sources were available.

Supports: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, VFAT.
